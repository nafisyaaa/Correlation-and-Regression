**Study Case**

You are a Data Analyst from PT Ashrae Energy: https://www.ashrae.org/. Data is a "modification" (Wrangling) of original data sourced from PT Ashrae: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ashrae-energy-prediction/data. So that the problems and data understanding are the same as the origin of the data. The data that will be used is the "average" of electrical energy usage from various buildings (no longer time-series / time dependent).
